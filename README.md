# How this is done

Surveying experienced investors is an important step in understanding the dynamics of the cannabis industry and identifying trends and patterns in investment behavior. There are several key questions that can be asked in such a survey, including:

When did you first invest in the cannabis industry?
What type of company did you invest in (e.g. cultivators, dispensaries, ancillary companies, etc.)?
What factors influenced your decision to invest in the cannabis industry?
What have been the biggest challenges you have faced as an investor in the cannabis industry?
What are your expectations for the future of the cannabis industry?
By gathering this information through a survey, we can gain a deeper understanding of the investment landscape in the cannabis industry and identify key trends and patterns in investment behavior. For example, we can see whether investment activity has increased or decreased over time, and whether certain types of companies are more popular among investors. Additionally, we can gain insight into the factors that influence investment decisions and the challenges that investors face in the cannabis industry.

Furthermore, by understanding the expectations of experienced investors, we can get a sense of what the future of the cannabis industry may look like and what type of companies may be more likely to succeed in the future. This information can be used to inform investment decisions and to help identify potential opportunities for new investors.

In summary, surveying experienced investors is an important step in understanding the dynamics of the cannabis industry and identifying trends and patterns in investment behavior. The information gathered through such a survey can be used to inform investment decisions and to help identify potential opportunities for new investors.


# Our Goal

We are excited to announce that we have started a new development project that aims to create an algorithm that can invest in cannabis-driven companies and startups worldwide. This project is driven by the growing interest in the cannabis industry and the increasing number of cannabis-related startups that are emerging around the world.

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can analyze and evaluate the performance of cannabis-related companies and startups, and make investment decisions based on that analysis. The algorithm will take into account a wide range of factors, including financial performance, market trends, legal and regulatory considerations, and the overall potential for growth in the cannabis industry.

The algorithm will be designed to be flexible and adaptable, so it can be used to invest in a wide range of cannabis-related companies and startups. This includes cultivators, dispensaries, ancillary companies, and other types of cannabis-related businesses.

In order to ensure that the algorithm is as accurate and effective as possible, we will be working with a team of experts with extensive experience in the cannabis industry, finance, and investment. They will be helping to develop and test the algorithm, and will also be providing ongoing support and guidance as the project progresses.

We are aware that the legal landscape of cannabis changes worldwide, so the algorithm will be designed to take into account the specific laws and regulations of the countries in which it is used.

Overall, we believe that this project has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the cannabis industry, providing investors with a powerful new tool for evaluating and investing in cannabis-related companies and startups. We look forward to sharing updates on the progress of this project as it develops.
